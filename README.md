This repository contains a website that showcases the services of a potential local business named BecauseIT. The website is designed with two web pages, both of which provide detailed information about the services offered by the business, including IT repair and configuration, web design, and technical consulting for various devices and computer components.

The main objective of this project is to present BecauseIT as a reliable and professional local business that provides top-quality IT services. The website's design is simple and easy to navigate, with a clean layout and a professional look and feel.

The website was created using basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.  HTML was used to structure the content and CSS to style and layout the website. While the project may be short and simple, it effectively conveys the business's services and provides a good starting point for expanding the website in the future.
